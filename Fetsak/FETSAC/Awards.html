            In walking along the road and crossing the road, deaf people have to
            face a lot of troubles due to the deformity inherited from their
            birth. Therefore, sometime this trouble may pave the path to an
            accident. Under such situation, an assisting device is highly
            recommended to overcome these troubles. These assisting devices
            which is available in the world produced in other counties, to
            overcome these problems, are very expensive. This Vehicle Notifier
            is an important device which helps the deaf people to understand
            sound coming out from the rear side and identify objects in the rear
            side, such as vehicle & other threats. With the help of this device
            they feel what is nearby them. This is a low cost product and it was
            made as a wearable belt, which is easy to use. The Vehicle Notifier
            is a micro controller base system with Bayesian classification
            method. This unit consists of distance measuring sensors and sound
            detecting sensor. The notification method of this system consists of
            vibrating motors with easy to identify vibrating variations.

            Y. A. I. Yatawara, a student of the Department of Electrical &
            Computer Engineering, won the prestigious Manamperi Award 2014 for
            the Best Inter-University Final Year Undergraduate Project in
            Engineering at a colourful ceremony recently held at the BMICH. This
            is an accolade given annually, for the inter-university best
            undergraduate project, by the Sri Lanka Association for the
            Advancement of Science (SLAAS). This is the 1st time an OUSL student
            won this award. He overcame serious competition from several other
            universities to win the award. Anusha received the award from the
            Minister of Science, Technology, and Research, Susil Premajayantha.
            The project, titled 'Automated Rubber Tapping Machine (Latex
            Tapper)', was completed as a part of Anusha’s B. Tech final year
            project at the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering and
            was supervised by Senior Lecturer Mr. Nuwan Balasuriya. The project
            was partially funded by a grant from the ERU research fund. The
            project is to develop a fully-automated rubber-tapper machine that
            can move from tree to tree and tap rubber. This is the 1rst stage of
            a two-stage project. Under this stage, an automated rubber tapper
            was developed that can automatically tap a single rubber tree.
            During the next stage, a mechanism will be developed to move the
            tapper from tree to tree. It also has the capability to detect
            aspects such as the thickness of the cut and the trajectory of the
            cut, and place the new cut accordingly. This machine can also remove
            and collect clogged latex, commonly known as ottapalu. This could be
            the first fully-automated rubber tapper in the world. In Sri Lanka,
            and also in other countries like Thailand and South India, there is
            a severe shortage of labour for rubber tapping and most of the
            rubber estates remain untapped. This will be a timely solution for
            this issue.
